#  Data Types, Constraints & Table Design

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- MySQL Database

## Description
In this task, I redesigned a `students` table using proper SQL data types and constraints.
I implemented PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE constraints to maintain data integrity.

I tested constraint behavior by inserting invalid data and observing errors.
I also modified the table structure using ALTER TABLE to add, rename, and drop columns.

## Concepts Covered
- SQL data types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, CHAR)
- PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL constraints
- ALTER TABLE operations
- Data validation at database level

## Outcome
This task helped me understand proper schema design and how constraints
protect data integrity in relational databases.
